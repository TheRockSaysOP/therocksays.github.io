## Welcome to TheRockSays Main Repository

Hello, i'm TheRockSays just a guy trying to be a developer, now just a web developer but in the future a game developer, you will see i guarantee.

Here I just want to talk to you, let me introduce myself.

I'm a 21 years old dude from Brazil, this account (TheRockSays) is like a alter ego, where i can do my things without people knowing how i'm, well at least most of the people don't know how i am, and to be clear i am just a non professional idiot that want to be good at something that i really like, and that is... computers.

### Languages that i personally like

Now i will talk about my choices of languages.
They can be much different from each other but i like them.


#### Java
> ```java
  System.out.println("Hello Java!");
  // a little too verbose language.
  ```
> Java is the main language that i learn in college, most of my work is done in Java and is the language that i'm most confortable with.
Before college i had some experience with this language because my favorite game at the time was written in it (Minecraft, and of course Java Edition, not that other bullshit).

#### Ruby
```ruby
puts "Hello Ruby!"
# a language with many problems that i love so much.
```
Ruby is my favorite language, that is a bit of a spoiler, i was not introduced to Ruby before my first real contact with the language.
Ruby has so many features and is built in a way that is actually pretty intuite, that fascinates me.

#### Python
```python
print("Hello Python!")
# a language that tries to do everything and most of them to right.
```
Python was my first language in college, i can say that is a good language, but i think it tries to do many things at once and i think someday that will become a massive tragedy.

#### C
```c
printf("Hello C!");
// a low level (considering the others above) that i love to control.
```
C was the first language that i tried that was "low-level", most of my curiosity was because i want to be a game developer, and most of the games are built in C or at least a family member of the C language like C++, C#, Objective C.
That would come handy, because of my grade of Data Structures and Algorithms, i developed it both with C and Java.

#### C++
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello C++!";
// the above with some things that doesn't make sense (initially) above it.
```
As i said, i want to be a game developer so i tried C, C++, C#, Rust, Lua (this one is from UFRJ here in Brazil), and C++ was one of them i liked the way it does thinks even though at first didn't make sense.

#### Perl
```perl
print("Hello Perl!");
# a dead (but not so dead) language that i like
```
Much of my love for this language is because is embedded everywhere, and mainly on Linux.


Note that i didn't wrote the main function on those languages that need it, just pretend that is there because if i wrote it out, it will take space that i don't want to use...

Maybe you want to know more about which language i like the most, than...
### Tierlist of languages

1. Ruby ♥️
2. C 🧑‍🔧
3. Java :smiling_imp:
4. C++ 💫
5. Python 🤟


Of course i know that there are a lot of other languages, like:
- Javascript
- Scala
- Kotlin
- Clojure
- Haskell
- TypeScript
- C#
- PHP
- Objective C
- Crystal 

> I will not name every other language come on...

I personally like functional languages, or that at least have some support of it.

Because right now i'm focused in web development, most of my programming right now is Java + Spring Boot, JUnit + Mockito, and some SQL with PostgreSQL.

Note that i want to be a game developer and functional programming is not the main feature the language has to have, and more, the Game Engine that i use Godot Engine, has its own programming language/scripting language [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html), so i tried many languages for maybe nothing, i just want to make sure i made this point clear, i'm not a master on those languages, i'm pretty good at Java, Ruby, C, Python, and that's it. 

### Operating Systems

Now i will talk about something that has a a huge influence on myself, operating systems.
I lived almost half of my life using Windown until i freed myself from the hands of Microsoft and embrace the journey to be a Linux user.
I say it like that because i always wanted to do some things with my computer as related things, and Windows prevented me of doing too much things.
Things that it was much more complex on Windows, Linux does it like it's effortless, it comes with its price but im willed to pay the price.

I'm doing something crazy by wanting to be a game developer and a Linux user at the same time, but i will do it.

I will not say some common things like: 

"You should start using Linux"_ or _"Linux is better than Windows"_;

Or anything like that, even though i actually should to say it, and meant to say it.

I just want to say that if you have a open mind, you should at least give it a try, and if you try and like it, it will change you whole life, i mean, the way you think, the perspective you have on anything, and many more.

Much of my love for Perl was because it is highly proximate with Linux, and because of that it became a huge part of myself on Linux.
Things like, awk, vim, find, grep/regex, pipes, redirection, telnet, netstat, ipconfig, dd, still blow my mind, even though i'm already using more complex things.

> Just to be clear i'm a Linux user so i like Bash Script, but i do not consider it a Programming Language like the other ones to be in that list.
```console
echo "Hello Bash Script!"
```

I do say to use Linux because Linux made myself a better person, the open source software movement made me think more than just a lonely guy with a dream, to a guy that knows he is part of something even bigger than the sum of its parts, a guy that not only can achieve his dreams, but also dream even further.

Be a game developer and Linux user is a dream and a obstacle, and as i said, since it is a dream, i can achieve that, i just have to fix the obstacle in my way right now.
