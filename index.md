## Welcome to TheRockSays Main Repository

Hello, i'm TheRockSays just a guy trying to be a developer, now just a web developer but in the future a game developer, you will see i guarantee.

![rammus-lol](/main-image-rammus.jpg){.rammus-img}

Right here i just want to talk to you, let me introduce myself, i'm a 21 years old guy from Brazil, this is my alter ego, a non professional idiot that just want to be good at something i really like, and that is... Computers.

### Languages that i personally like

They can be much different from each other but i like them.

```java
System.out.println("Hello Java!");
// a little too verbose language.
```
```ruby
puts "Hello Ruby!"
# a language with many problems that i love so much.
```
```python
print("Hello Python!")
# a language that tries to do everything and most of them to right.
```
```c
printf("Hello C!");
// a low level (considering the others above) that i love to control.
```
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello C++!";
// the above with some things that doesn't make sense (initially) above it.
```
```perl
print("Hello Perl!");
# a dead (but not so dead) language that i like
```
Note that i didn't wrote the main function on those languages that need it, just pretend that is there because if i wrote it out, it will take space that i don't want to use...

Maybe you want to know more about which language i like the most, than...
### Tierlist of languages

1. Ruby ♥️
2. C 🧑‍🔧
3. Java :smiling_imp:
4. C++ 💫
5. Python 🤟


Of course i know that there are a lot of other languages, like:
- Javascript
- Scala
- Kotlin
- Clojure
- Haskell
- TypeScript
- C#
- PHP
- Objective C
- Crystal 

* I will not name every other language common...

I personally like functional languages, or that at least have some support of it.
Because right now i'm focused in web development, most of my programming right now is Java + Spring Boot, JUnit + Mockito, and some SQL with PostgreSQL.

### Operating Systems

Now i will talk about something that has a a huge influence on myself, operating systems.
I lived almost half of my life using Windown until i freed myself from the hands of Microsoft and embrace the journey to be a Linux user.
I say it like that because i always wanted to do some things with my computer as related things, and Windows prevented me of doing too much things.
Things that it was much more complex on Windows, Linux does it like it's effortless, it comes with its price but im willed to pay the price.

I will not say some common things like, you should start using Linux, Linux is better than Windows, or anything like that, even though i actually want to say it.
I just want to say that if you have a open mind, you should at least try it, and if you like it, it will change you whole life, the way you think, the perspective you have on anything, and many more.
