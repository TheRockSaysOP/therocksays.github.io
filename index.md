Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Languages that i personally like

They can be much different from each other but i like them.

```java
System.out.println("Hello Java!");
// a little too verbose language.
```
```ruby
puts "Hello Ruby!"
# a language with many problems that i love so much.
```
```python
print("Hello Python!")
# a language that tries to do everything and most of them to right.
```
```c
printf("Hello C!");
// a low level (considering the others above) that i love to control.
```
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello C++!";
// the above with some things that doesn't make sense (initially) above it.
```
Note that i didn't wrote the main function on those languages that need it, just pretend that is there because if i wrote it out, it will take space that i don't want to use...

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TheRockSaysOP/therocksays.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
